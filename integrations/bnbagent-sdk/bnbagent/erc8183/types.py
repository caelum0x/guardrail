"""Shared types and constants for the ERC-8183 SDK.

Mirrors the enums and reason codes defined by the ERC-8183 contract stack:

- ``JobStatus`` — order-dependent with ``IACP.JobStatus`` in the Solidity kernel.
- ``Verdict`` — order-dependent with ``VERDICT_*`` constants in
  ``EvaluatorRouterUpgradeable`` and ``OptimisticPolicy``.
- ``REASON_APPROVED`` / ``REASON_REJECTED`` — ``keccak256`` reason codes emitted
  by ``OptimisticPolicy``; also re-exported as hex strings for logging.

Any change to the on-chain enum / constant layout MUST be reflected here,
otherwise ``ERC8183Client.get_job(...).status`` and verdict comparisons will
silently drift.
